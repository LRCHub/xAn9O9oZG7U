We walked the loneliest mile
We smile without any style
We kiss all together wrong
No intention

We lie about each other's drinks
We live without each other
Thinking what anyone would do

Without me and you

It's like I told you
Only the lonely can play

So hold on here we go
Hold on to nothin' we know
I feel so lonely
Way up here

You mention the time we were together
So long ago well I don't remember
All I know is it makes me feel good now

It's like I told you only the lonely can play
Only the lonely only the lonely can play

Only the lonely only the lonely can play
It's like I told you only the lonely can play
Only the lonely
Only the lonely can play
